Mapping process

1. 	Get data from sifts_xref_residue table 
	import in SEGMENT_CATH and SEGMENT_SCOP, 
	concatain data from the both tables on auth_asym_id in SEGMENT_CATH_SCOP

2. 	Domain mapping
	compare start/end residue numbers
	calculate percentage and overlapping for domains
	enter data in PDBE_ALL_DOMAIN_MAPPING

3. 	Node mapping
	calculate percentage, overlapping, medals for nodes (superfamilies) 
	enter data in PDBE_ALL_NODE_MAPPING

4. 	Clustering
	Clustering nodes using PDBE_ALL_DOMAIN_MAPPING and PDBE_ALL_NODE_MAPPING
	enter data in CLUSTER

5. 	MDA blocks
	Determine MDA blocks for each cluster (MDA block is a sequence of following CATH and SCOP domain superfamilies)
	enter data in MDA_BLOCKS
	link block with CLUSTER in CLUSTER_BLOCK

6. 	Get chain and uniprot IDs
	For each MDA block, get chains ID with uniprot ID and uniprot coverage percentage corresponding
	link chain with MDA_BLOCK in BLOCK_CHAIN
	write mda_blocks.list (uniprot with number of chain for each block) and mda_info.list (for each uniprot in each block: chain and coverage)

7. 	Determine subcategories 
	chopping: equivalence split, one instance, class4...
	homology differences
	write info in files
