Mapping process

Need to create config.pl file where to write information about database connexion for pdbe_test (db, user and password) 

Main program is mapping_process.pl
All the files are wrote under MDA_results/CATH_4_1 directory

1. 	Get different PDB entries data from sifts_xref_residue table (get_segment.pm)
	import in SEGMENT_CATH and SEGMENT_SCOP, 
	concatain data from the both tables on auth_asym_id in SEGMENT_CATH_SCOP

2. 	Domain mapping (domain_mapping.pm)
	compare start/end residue numbers
	calculate percentage and overlapping for domains
	enter data in PDBE_ALL_DOMAIN_MAPPING

3. 	Node mapping (node_mapping.pm)
	calculate percentage, overlapping, medals for nodes (superfamilies) 
	if sequence coverage by CATH domain and by SCOP domain > 25% => enter data in PDBE_ALL_NODE_MAPPING

4. 	Clustering (clustering.pm)
	Clustering nodes using PDBE_ALL_DOMAIN_MAPPING and PDBE_ALL_NODE_MAPPING
	if average domain coverage at SF level > 25% and overlapping between CATH and SCOP > 25% => enter data in CLUSTER

5. 	MDA blocks (get_mda_blocks.pl)
	Determine MDA blocks for each cluster (MDA block is a sequence of following CATH and SCOP domain superfamilies)
	if overlapping between CATH and SCOP > 50% => enter data in MDA_BLOCKS with different CATH and SCOP domains begin-end positions
	link with cluster in CLUSTER_BLOCK table

6. 	Get chain and uniprot IDs (get_mda_blocks.pl)
	For each MDA block, get chains ID with uniprot ID and uniprot sequence coverage percentage by the chain corresponding
	enter data into BLOCK_CHAIN and BLOCK_UNIPROT tables
	Write mda_blocks.list (uniprot with number of chain for each block) and mda_info.list (for each uniprot in each block: chain and coverage)

7. 	Determine subcategories (get_chop_homo.pm)
	chopping: equivalence split, one instance, class4...
	homology differences
	write info in files
