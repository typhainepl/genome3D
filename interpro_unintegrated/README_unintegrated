Get list of unintegrated Gene3D and SUPERFAMILY in InterPro, adapted to genome3d trac pages tables

Need to create db.cfg file where to write information about database connexion for pdbe_test (pdbeUser, pdbePass and pdbeHost) 
and interpro (ipproUser,ipproPass and ipproHost)

Main program is get_particular_block.py, calls search_unintegrated.py

1. the main script must be called with 2 arguments: 
	- number (1: gold blocks, 2: 2domains-1domain same SF, 3: 2domains different SF-1domain)
	- name of file where the program will write unintegrated superfamilies

2. For each cluster corresponding to the number specified, get the different blocks

3. For each block:
	- search if gold (same number of CATH and SCOP SF in cluster and same number of CATH and SCOP in block)
	- search if one to many domains (if CATH is splitted in multiple domains (without other domain from another SF between domains) while SCOP has only one domain)

4. search if unintegrated GENE3D and SUPERFAMILY signatures into InterPro and search of number of corresponding proteins and 
print unintegrated in file

5. print number of :
	- unintegrated GENE3D
	- unintegrated SUPERFAMILY
	- unintegrated clusters (pairs)
