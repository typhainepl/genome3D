Get list of unintegrated Gene3D and SUPERFAMILY in InterPro

Need to create db.cfg file where to write information about database connexion for pdbe_test (pdbeUser, pdbePass and pdbeHost) 
and interpro (ipproUser,ipproPass and ipproHost)

Main program is get_particular_block.py, calls interpro/search_unintegrated.py

1. Clean directory files

2. For each cluster, get the different blocks

3. For each block:
	- search if gold (same number of CATH and SCOP SF in cluster and same number of CATH and SCOP in block)
	- search if one to many domains (if CATH is splitted in multiple domains (without other domain from another SF between domains) while SCOP has only one domain)

4. search if unintegrated GENE3D and SUPERFAMILY signatures into InterPro and search of number of corresponding proteins
	- print unintegrated gold in unintegrated_gold_blocks file
	- print unintegrated one to many in unintegrated_one_to_many

5. print number of unintegrated gold and one_to_many in corresponding files
